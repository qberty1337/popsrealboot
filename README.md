# POPS realboot

POPS realboot is a plugin for the PSP that let’s you authentically boot your PS1 games with the classic two part SCE intro for the original PlayStation. By authentic, I mean the real, true PS1 boot intro that includes the orange diamond on white SCE logo that naturally blends into the PS logo.

Installation:

1. Extract pops-realboot folder into your SEPLUGINS folder
2. Place your dumped PS1 BIOS into the folder and rename it bios.bin
3. Enable the plugin as POPS with your CFW
   -> For ARK add "ps1, pops-realboot/pops_realboot.prx, on" to your PLUGINS.TXT
   -> For non-ARK add "ms0:/SEPLUGINS/pops-realboot/pops_realboot.prx, 1" to your POPS.TXT
4. Run your favourite PS1 game!
